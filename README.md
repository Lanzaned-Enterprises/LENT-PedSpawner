# LENT-PedSpawner
*Extensive modified ped spawner to allow users to create mp peds and even standard peds for any purpose.*

## What is the Ped Spawner?
The PedSpawner is a resource on the FiveM Platform that can be used to create passive/hostile peds around your map. These peds can range from all models that currently exist and using target functions you can have these peds execute client & server events alike. They could give money, dialog, items and anything you might need.

This resource was made with the extensive purpose of using mp_freemode characters which many scripts don't utilize. As much as it's understandable due to the mass amounts of different EUP with the big config file for the ped you can customize it's clothes, hair and basically any property. 

## What can I use the Ped Spawner for?
The PedSpawner can be used for a few different scenario's. You can use them to create guards for areas you don't want your players to access even having the ability to make them invincible. You can execute events from other scripts which might give you rewards, items, money or other things wished on the owner / developers choosing.
